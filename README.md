# auto-repair-engage

Develop a landing page for Southside Auto Repair, emphasizing user engagement and functionality. Key features include:

Online Booking System: Enable customers to book appointments directly on the website. Implement a user-friendly calendar and service selection interface.

Chat Bot for Repair Inquiries: Integrate a chat bot that can answer questions about repairs, available services, and general inquiries, enhancing customer service.

User Profiles for Invoice and Repair History: Allow customers to create profiles to access their invoice history and receive tailored repair recommendations.

Backend Appointment Scheduling: For the backend, implement a system for scheduling appointments, sending reminders, and uploading videos showing specific repair needs to customers.

Showcase of Products and Services: Present our range of products and services in an engaging manner, possibly using cards or lists that are easy to navigate.

Design with 3D Elements and Easy Navigation: The website should have a modern design with 3D elements and icons, ensuring it's visually appealing and easy to navigate.

Focus on creating a responsive design that offers a seamless experience across devices. The platform should be built with scalability in mind, using React for the frontend to ensure dynamic user interactions and a serverless backend for efficiency and ease of maintenance.
